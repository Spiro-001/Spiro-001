Software Developer | Spiro - 001

To whoever is reading this I'll introduce myself to you. I am a person who enjoys tinkering with everything I come in contact with. Curiosity is my motivation to
understand the things I do not understand. I'm sure that there are many out there just like me and want to persue the idea of constantly learning. Software Development
is the one field that seemed like it connected everything I enjoy together. Robotics, Mechanical Engineering, Physics, Games, Math, and Music. All of these have a
relationship with Software Development. Personally, I enjoy using C++ as it was the first language I learned and is the most logical language to me. Python would be
my second language of choice due to its simplicity. Currently my goal is to master C++ and be comfortable enough to move on to Mechanical Engineering along side
Electric Engineering. Being able to master these skills will allow me to work on Robotics. I personally do not want to be on one side of the team, rather be all
around the team and be able to provide feedback in all departments.
